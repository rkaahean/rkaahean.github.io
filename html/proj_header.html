  Over the course of my academic journey, I have explored various domains in data. Just like
evvvvveryone else, I was drawn into the data science field. I raved about Machine Learning models and deep learning,
and I decided to pursue the Master's in Business Analytics program at UCLA Anderson. I've learnt the importance of
interacting with customers and clients, which many industry professionals emphasize , and even rate over technical
skills. Lately however, I've been deep diving into the Data Engineering field, and the numerous types of technology
stacks never fails to suprise me.

From my minimal experience in this field, the one thing that I've learnt is that even if the job description does note
call for it explicitly, having even little experience across all the domains is extremely important, and I've found
that implementing projects is a good way to get said experience.
