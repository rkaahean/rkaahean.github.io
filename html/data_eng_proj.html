      Timeseries DB revamp
    </div>

    <div class="situation">
      <p>A client needed to transition from MySQL database to a more faster solution due to the nature of the data which streamed at nearly 500,000 rows per second.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
      I came up with the alternative of MemSQL, a fast, scalable, and most importantly, compatible version of MySQL. The goal was to acheive a sub 1 second latency
      on queries.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
      With nearly a month's worth of data, spanning 55M rows, I ran benchmark scripts using dbbench to evaluate various configuration of MemSQL.
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      I was able to setup, test and deploy a MemSQL cluster on a DigitalOcean droplet, which lead to sub 1s, (a 500% performance boost) on 40+ concurrent loads, for a mere
      40$ / month.

       Fact & dimensional modelling
     </div>

    <div class="situation">
        As part of a class project, I had to interact with a startup on revamping the way database which was accessed by Dashboards and other Analytical Tools
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        The main aim was to come up with what are called Facts and dimensions, which is a conceptual procedure of sorts on structuring the database based on business
        needs.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
        The facts revolved usually around a business function and the dimensions the components that make up said business function. Structuring this involved multiple
        meetings with the client, and implementing in Snowflake, feeding in data from the old database.
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      The newly structured database was not only 17% faster, but also simplified access for Data & Business Analysts.
    </div>
