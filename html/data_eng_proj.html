      Timeseries DB revamp.
    </div>

    <div class="situation">
      <p>A client needed to transition from MySQL database to a more faster solution due to the nature of the data which streamed at nearly 500,000 rows per second.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
      I came up with the alternative of MemSQL, a fast, scalable, and most importantly, compatible version of MySQL. The goal was to acheive a sub 1 second latency
      on queries.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
      With nearly a month's worth of data, spanning 55M rows, I ran benchmark scripts using dbbench to evaluate various configuration of MemSQL.
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      I was able to setup, test and deploy a MemSQL cluster on a DigitalOcean droplet, which lead to sub 1s, (a 500% performance boost) on 40+ concurrent loads, for a mere
      40$ / month.
