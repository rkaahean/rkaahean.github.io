      Causal Effects of Soda Tax
    </div>

    <div class="situation">
      <p>In lieu of the rising sugar content in beverages, the US government imposed a soda tax; Customers would have to pay an additional
        amount for beverages with sugar content.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
      But the main question was if the taxation was actually effective in reducing the consumption of aforementioned beverages.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
      The data of the purchase of the beverages was collected before and after the tax was introduced, and for bordering regions, one which
      had soda taxation, and the other did not.
    </div>

    <div class="result">
        It was found that even though the consumption of sugary beverages reduced in the taxed city, it was just due to the fact that Customers
        were willing to travel over to purchase the cheaper alternatives.
