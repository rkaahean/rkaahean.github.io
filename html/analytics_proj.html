      LAFD Fire Response Analysis
    </div>

    <div class="situation">
      <p>I was looking to ways to use data analytics to help prevent the seasonal fires in southern california, and help better the response of the fire
        departments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
      Upon coming across ~5M+ rows of data, I decided to come up & feature engineer metrics based on which I could evaluate the performance of the fire departments.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
      After using Pandas & Python to come up with metrics like ResponseTime & DispatchTime, I determined, on average, which fire departments took the
      longest to dispatch and which ones were burdened,
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      After identifying the Top 5 most affected site, I was able to suggest at 17% increase in physical resources like FireTrucks & Dispatch Vehicles to the
      affected sites.

       Soccer Analysis
     </div>

    <div class="situation">
        Due to my ever lasting love for soccer and the increasingly important role of analytics in the soccer industry, I decided to analyze the statistics of popular teams
        and players.
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        Although my goal was to analyze statistics like interceptions, through balls etc., I also wanted to visualize them and present my findings in a way that
        could be understood by the lay man.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
        The data was rarely present in a clean format; I scraped data through tools like Selenium. To present the data
        I used a mix of Tableau & Python. I posted a writeup on twitter along with the visuals to generate discussion
        and gather critical feedback.
    </div>

    <div class="result">
      <br>
      I gathered nearly 200 followers in this process.
